Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted a web game developed for pictionary basically where there was players a timer and a drawing board. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel that I did particularly well at getting all of the necessary information for the client about the things that they would need to consider for all of the different operating systems

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Personally this did not help me with the code it just kind of made it harder for me to work through it since this is not how my brain functions while coding.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Personally I would not revise this because I feel I put in all of the necessary information to best help the client 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
You must always consider the users needs because you need to best complete the project that they are presenting you with and if you do not understand what they are asking/requesting then there is no way that you would be able to truly help them to accomplish their vision. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Keep your steps simple and make sure to always use the best standards and practices especially when it comes to security because if you are unable to protect what you are developing then there is no way that other people will want to use it.
